This is a program that allows the user to create and store a checklist for a holiday.
It starts by asking the user their holiday destination followed by how many things they
need to pack as well as how many tasks they need to complete. The user should be able to enter 
each item they need to pack and each task they need to complete.

There are two versions of the sourcecode, one for PyCharm and the other for IDLE.
